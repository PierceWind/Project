GREETINGS! This program is for educational purposes only. 
    This is a partial requirement of our course System Analysis and Design. 
    This project was coded starting from November 01, 2022 until Dec 12, 2022. 
    Through our rigor and determination, we made this system as a first timer. 
    The languages used are the following: js and php that includes html and css. 

ALL ABOUT THE PROJECT 
    The group aspire to create a system that will need less work in terms of checking an attendance. 
    They propose to build a system  titled Student Attendance Monitoring System using QR Code
        for their own school, DFCAMLP-IT Campus to check the attendance of students once they enter 
        the school premises and their classes without much  hassle and to generat a report having 
        accurate, precise, and reliable data. 
    The programmers will be happy at your advices and suggestions regarding their system. 
    They believed that no perfect system exist and doesn't mean it will be excluded from innovation 
        and development. They hope that their system will be upgraded and debugged.
